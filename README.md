# Tauri Search app

When I type notes with my keyboard, I always find it hard to switch to the touchpad to find the book, then the chapter, and scroll down to the verse. With this, I can quickly type in the book using fuzzy search, followed by the chapter and verse, and it automatically opens in JW Library.

On Android, make sure to grant the extra permission in the app settings for JW Library. Enable the setting to allow opening links from JW.org.
